### Overview
This project explores the Student Depression Dataset (2022) to uncover how academic pressure, sleep, and lifestyle choices impact student mental health.
The analysis focuses on identifying patterns of depression, stress, and suicidal thoughts across age groups, genders, degree types, and cities.

📊 Tools Used: Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboards)
📁 Dataset: Kaggle – Student Depression Dataset (2022)
📅 Year: 2022 | 🔢 Rows: 27,902 | Columns: 18

### Objective
To analyze how lifestyle and academic variables contribute to student depression, providing evidence-based insights for universities and policymakers.

###Data Preparation
Steps Performed:
1. Removed duplicates and standardized missing values.
2. Converted categorical variables (e.g., Depression Status) into readable formats.
3. Created derived features:
- Age_Group → Teen, Young Adult, Middle-Aged
- Sleep_Category → <5h, 5–6h, 7–8h, >8h
- Academic_Pressure_Level → Low, Medium, High
4. Rounded numeric columns (CGPA, pressure score) for readability.
  
### Key Findings
1. Sleep Deprivation and Academic Pressure
- Students sleeping <5 hours/day show the highest depression rates.
- Top-stress cities: Vasai-Virar (3.76), Kolkata (3.74), Ludhiana (3.73).
- Indicates the urgent need for sleep hygiene and stress-reduction programs.

2. Gender Insight
Male students (9,115) show higher depression rates than female students (7,221) — a reversal of common assumptions.
